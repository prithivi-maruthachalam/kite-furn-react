## For Contributors
- Pages are organised into individual folders inside components/
- Each page has an index file where all components in that page are imported
- Write styles in individual files for each component and import the style only once in the corresponding component's file.
- Write components as horizontal sections of a page, where each component is one horizontal strip (refer home page for more)
- Create a new branch for each component
- Refer exisitng code for the home page incase of any ambiguity regarding styling, sytax and project structure.
